# Neural Networks and Deep Learning
This folder contains the final homeworks for the course **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**, attended in 2021/22 a.y. and held by professor Alberto Testolin.<br>

The notebooks are in the form of reports, containing code and markdown, written using the PyTorch library. In detail, they cover
  - **HW1**: Supervised learning, with a regression and classification tasks;
  - **HW2**: Unsupervised learning, exploring different kinds of autoencoders;
  - **HW3**: Reinforcement learning, dealing with Deep Q-learning Networks (DQNs) applied to solving two environments from the OpenAI `gym`.
