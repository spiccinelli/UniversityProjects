# Metodi Computazionali della Fisica

As an outsider project, this folder contains the material for the final exam for the course **Metodi Computazionali della Fisica**, attended in 2019/20 a.y. and held by professor Paolo Umari (Bachelor's degree in Physics).

The folder contains the C++ code for the solution to the Schr√∂dinger equation for a gaussian-like wave function with a potential barrier in both the 1D and 2D case. In the `animations` folder are stored the output gifs from the simulation which are quite fun to look at.
