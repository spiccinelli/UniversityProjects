# Advanced Statistics for Physics Analysis

This folder contains all exercises and final projects for the course **Advanced Statistics for Physics Analysis**, attended in 2020/21 a.y. and held by by professor Alberto Garfagnini.<br>
The course involved weekly exercises in R with topics ranging from basic probability concepts (Bayes theorem, discrete and continuous probabilty distributions) to more advanced ones such as Bayesian inference and hypothesis testing.<br>
In detail the notebooks cover:
  - R basics;
  - Probability distributions 1;
  - Probability distributions 2;
  - Six boxes toy model;
  - Bayesian inference 1;
  - Bayesian inference 2;
  - Hypothesis testing.
