# Quantum Information and Computing
This folder contains the final homeworks for the course **Quantum Information and Computing**, attended in 2021/22 a.y. and held by professor Simone Montangero.<br>

The course covers an introduction to computational quantum physics and tensor network methods, one of the most versatile simulation approaches exploited in the quantum many-body regime. The weekly assignments written in Fortran are each divided into a `CODE` and `SLIDES` folder, containing the source code and a 6-slides long presentation for each topic.

#### Final Project
**Supervisor**: Simone Montangero<br>
**Title**: "Random Number Characterization via Quantum Inspired Machine Learning"<br>
**Authors**: [Tommaso Faorlin](https://github.com/FaoTom), [Alessandro Marcomini](https://github.com/AleMarcomini), [Samuele Piccinelli](https://github.com/spiccinelli/)<br>

The project has also been presented in a [poster](https://github.com/spiccinelli/UniversityProjects/blob/master/Quantum%20Information%20and%20Computing/FinalProject_Poster.pdf) at the European Spring School in Quantum Science and Technology held in [Strasburg](https://strasbourg2022.eu/) in April 2022.
