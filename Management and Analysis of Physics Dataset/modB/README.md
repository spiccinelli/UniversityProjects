## mod. B

In this second module we tackled topics like storage models, file and cloud systems as well as distributed computing software.<br>
The assignment consists in exercises concerning redundancy, basic criptography, object storage technology, REST APIs and block chain technology.

#### Final Project
**Supervisors**: Prof. Jacopo Pazzini and Dr. Alberto Zucchetta<br>
**Title**: "Setting an upper limit on the branching ratio of FCNC ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=t\bar{t}) processes with CMS data: a distributed approach"

This is a distributed approach to the project developed in the second module of [Laboratory of Computational Physics](https://github.com/spiccinelli/UniversityProjects/tree/master/Laboratory%20of%20Computational%20Physics/modB).<br>
All the work was shared with [Chiara Maccani](https://github.com/chiaramaccani), [Tommaso Stentella](https://github.com/TommasoStentella) and [Cristina Venturini](https://github.com/cristinaventurini).
