# Quantum Cryptography and Security
This folder contains the reports for the course **Quantum Cryptography and Security**, attended in 2021/22 a.y. and held by professors Giuseppe Vallone and Nicola Laurenti.<br>

The work involved data acquisition in the CNR-IFN laboratories in Via Trasea, Padua. The messy notebooks for the data analysis are omitted.<br>
The topics cover:
  - **Report1**: Quantum random number generators;
  - **Report3**: Quantum key distribution (QKD).

Moreover, together with [Tommaso Faorlin](https://github.com/FaoTom) and [Alessandro Marcomini](https://github.com/AleMarcomini), we wrote in LaTeX the full set of [lecture notes](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qhdjxywgxkfr) of the course.
