  - **Report2**: Photon anti-correlation effect on a beam splitter;
  - **Report3**: Beam optics;
  - **Report4**: Quantum random number generators and quantum key distribution.

The homework contains some exercises on the quantum description of light while the essay is a short review on the emission and absorption coefficients of Einstein.
