This folder contains weekly exercises aimed at introducing the basic tools of Python and data analysis, visualization, algorithms and much more.<br>
The content of the notebooks is:

  - **Ex00**, **Ex01**, **Ex02**: Introduction, Fundamentals and Number Representation;
  - **Ex03**: Numpy for generic computational problems;
  - **Ex04**, **Ex05**: Data handling with Pandas;
  - **Ex06**: Visualization with Matplotlib;
  - **Ex07.1**, **Ex07.2**: Algorithms, with modules like Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib;
  - **Ex08**: Monte Carlo techniques;
  - **Ex09**: introduction to Numba and parallel computing fundamentals.

For the final project, in group we implemented a mean timer techinque to reconstruct the tracks of muons passing through a calorimeter, making use of the Pandas library.
