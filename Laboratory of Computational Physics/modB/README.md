## mod. B
For the second module of the course, we explored various machine learning algorithms and applications in Python.<br>
The weekly assignments cover the following topics:
  - Gradient Descent;
  - Deep Neural Networks with Keras;
  - Convolutional Neural Networks with Keras;
  - Clustering (tSNE and DBSCAN);
  - Restricted Boltzman Machines (RBMs).

Additionally, we wrote a mock scientific paper titled "Data visualization with t-SNE and clustering with DBSCAN".

#### Final project
**Supervisors**: Prof. Marco Zanetti and Dr. Alberto Zucchetta<br>
**Title**: "Search for flavor-changing neutral currents in processes in multilepton final states in ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=t\bar{t}) proton-proton collisions with the CMS detector"<br>

All the work was shared with [Chiara Maccani](https://github.com/chiaramaccani), [Tommaso Stentella](https://github.com/TommasoStentella) and [Cristina Venturini](https://github.com/cristinaventurini).
